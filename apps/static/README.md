# static / SSG

This app is the `static` Astro project. It is set-up in SSG (Server Side Generation) mode.
The whole website generates into the `dist` folder statically.

Use this Astro project to generate all routes that are statically available.
They may contain client code (JavaScript code executed at runtime), but SSR (Server Side Rendering)
is not activated here.
